# property-listing-sample-website
very basic sample website for property listing 

tech stack used -> using react js

project type -> frontend project

do----------> npm install react-scripts --save <-------------- before npm start to add nodemodules 


nodemodules is very space occupying folder it should not be added to git thats why


good luck
